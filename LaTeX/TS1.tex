This is an explanation of what happens in the Lean files leading up to FiniteWeightedComplex.lean. The goal is to define the "weighted complex" (a subcomplex of the Coxeter complex of the
symmetric group), to prove that it is shellable and to calculate its Euler-Poincar√© characteristic. The sections correspond to separate Lean files, the subsectino to the
internal organizations of these files.
