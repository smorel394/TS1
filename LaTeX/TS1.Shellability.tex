\section{Shellable abstract simplicial complexes}

We fix a set $\alpha$ and an abstract simplicial complex $K$ on $\alpha$.

\subsection{Shelling orders}

\begin{subdefi}[IsShellingOrder]
A linear order $r$ on the facets of $K$ is called a \emph{shelling order} if it is well-founded and if, for
every facet $s$ of $K$, the complex of old faces corresponding to $s$ is either empty or pure of dimension
$card(s)-2$.

\end{subdefi}


\subsection{The restriction map}

\begin{subdefi}[ShellingOrderRestriction\_aux \& ShellingOrderRestriction]
The "restriction map" for a partial order $s$ on the facets of $K$. It sends a facet $s$ of $K$ to the set
of vertices $a$ of $K$ such that $a\in s$ and $s\setminus\{a\}$ is a face of the complex of old faces.

\end{subdefi}

\begin{sublemma}[ShellingOrderRestriction\_mem]
Let $r$ be a partial order on the facets of $K$, $s$ be a facet of $K$ and $a$ be an element of $\alpha$. Then $a$ is
in the image of $s$ by the restriction map if and only if $a\in s$, $s\ne\{a\}$ and there exists a facet $u$ of $K$ such
that $u<_r s$ and $s\setminus\{a\}\subset u$.

\end{sublemma}

\begin{sublemma}[ShellingOrderRestriction\_smaller]
Let $r$ be a partial order on the facets of $K$ and $s$ be a facet of $K$. Then the image of $s$ by the restriction map is
contained in $s$.

\end{sublemma}

\begin{sublemma}[not\_containing\_restriction\_is\_old\_face]
Let $r$ be a partial order on the facets of $K$, $s$ be a facet of $K$ and $t$ be a face of $K$ such that $t\subset s$ and
the image of $s$ by the restriction map is not contained in $t$. Then $t$ is a face of the complex of old faces defined by $s$.

\end{sublemma}

\begin{sublemma}[old\_face\_does\_not\_contain\_restriction]
Let $r$ be a partial order on the facets of $K$, $s$ be a facet of $K$ and $t$ be a finite subset of $\alpha$. We suppose that
the complex of old faces defined by $s$ is pure of dimension $card(s)-2$ and that $t$ is a face of this complex. Then
the image of $s$ by the restriction map is not contained in $t$.

\end{sublemma}


\subsection{The smallest facet map}

\begin{subdefi}[ExistsFacet]
We say that $K$ satisfies condition $ExistsFacet$ if every face of $K$ is contained in a facet.

\end{subdefi}

\begin{sublemma}[Noetherian\_ExistsFacet]
If the face poset of $K$ is Noetherian, then $K$ satisfies condition $ExistsFacet$.

\end{sublemma}

\begin{subdefi}[ShellingOrderSmallestFacet]
Let $r$ be a well-order on the facets of $K$; we suppose that $K$ satisfies condition $ExistsFacet$.
The smallest facet map sends a face $s$ of $K$ to the smallest (for $r$) facet containing $s$.

\end{subdefi}

\begin{sublemma}[ShellingOrderSmallestFacet\_bigger]
Let $r$ be a well-order on the facets of $K$; we suppose that $K$ satisfies condition $ExistsFacet$.
Then every face of $K$ is contained in its image by the smallest facet map.

\end{sublemma}

\begin{sublemma}[ShellingOrderSmallestFacet\_smallest]
Let $r$ be a well-order on the facets of $K$; we suppose that $K$ satisfies condition $ExistsFacet$.
Let $s$ be a face of $K$ and $u$ be a facet of $K$ such that $s\le u$. Then $u$ is bigger for $r$ or equal
to the image of $s$ by the smallest facet map.

\end{sublemma}


\subsection{Shellability vs decomposability}

\begin{sublemma}[ShellableIsDecomposable]
Let $r$ be a shelling order on the facets of $K$, and suppose that $K$ satisfies condition $ExistsFacet$. Then the restriction
map and the smallest facet map form a decomposition of $K$.

\end{sublemma}

\begin{sublemma}[ShellableofDecomposable]
Let $(R,DF)$ be a decomposition of $K$, and $r$ be a well-order on the facets of $K$ that is compatible with $DF$. Then $r$ is a
shelling order.

\end{sublemma}

\begin{sublemma}[ExistsFacetofDecomposable]
Let $(R,DF)$ be a decomposition of $K$. Then $K$ satifies condition $ExistsFacet$.

\end{sublemma}

\begin{sublemma}[ShellableofDecomposable\_smallestfacet]
Let $(R,DF)$ be a decomposition of $K$, and $r$ be a well-order on the facets of $K$ that is compatible with $DF$. Then the smallest facet
map for $r$ is equal to $DF$.

\end{sublemma}

\begin{sublemma}[ShellableofDecomposable\_intervals]
Let $(R,DF)$ be a decomposition of $K$, and $r$ be a well-order on the facets of $K$ that is compatible with $DF$. For every facet
$s$ of $K$. the decomposition interval of $s$ for $(R,DF)$ is equal to its decomposition interval for the decomposition defined by
the shelling order $r$.

\end{sublemma}
