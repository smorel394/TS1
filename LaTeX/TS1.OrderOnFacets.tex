\section{Orders on the facets of a complex}

We fix a set $\alpha$ and an abstract simplicial complex $K$ on $\alpha$.

\subsection{The complex of old faces}

\begin{subdefi}[OldFaces]
Let $r$ be a partial order on the set of facets of $K$ and $s$ be a facet of $K$. We consider the abstract simplicial subcomplex
$L$ of $K$ generated by all facets $t$ such that $t<_r s$. The complex of \emph{old faces} defined by $r$ and $s$
is the abstract simplicial subcomplex of $L$ generated by $s$.

\end{subdefi}

\begin{sublemma}[OldFaces\_mem]
Let $r$ be a partial order on the set of facets of $K$ and $s$ be a facet of $K$. A finite subset $t$ of $\alpha$ is a face of
the complex of old faces if and only $t$ is a face of $K$, $t\subset s$ and there exists a facet $u$ of $K$ such that $u<_r s$ and
$t\subset u$.

\end{sublemma}

\begin{sublemma}[OldFaces\_included\_in\_boundary]
Let $r$ be a partial order on the set of facets of $K$ and $s$ be a facet of $K$. The complex of old faces is included in the
boundary of $s$.

\end{sublemma}

\begin{sublemma}[OldFacesFinite]
Let $r$ be a partial order on the set of facets of $K$ and $s$ be a facet of $K$. The complex of old faces is finite.

\end{sublemma}

\begin{sublemma}[OldFacesNonempty\_implies\_not\_vertex]
Let $r$ be a partial order on the set of facets of $K$ and $s$ be a facet of $K$. If the complex of old faces is nonempty,
then $s$ has cardinality $\geq 2$.

\end{sublemma}
