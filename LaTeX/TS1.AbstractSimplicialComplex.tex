\section{Abstract simplicial complexes}

Let $\alpha$ be a set.

\subsection{Generalities}

\begin{subdefi}[AbstractSimplicialComplex]
An \emph{abstract simplicial complex} $K$ on $\alpha$ is a set of nonempty finite subsets of $\alpha$ (called \emph{faces} of $K$) such that, if
$s$ is face of $K$ and $t$ is a nonempty subset of $s$, then $t$ is a face of $K$.
\end{subdefi}

\begin{subdefi}[of\_erase]
If we have a set $S$ of finite subsets of $\alpha$ that is a lower set for inclusion, then we get an abstract simplicial complex whose faces
are the nonempty elements of $S$.

\end{subdefi}

\begin{subdefi}[of\_subcomplex]
If $K$ is an abstract simplicial complex and $S$ is a set of faces of $K$ that is a lower set for inclusion, then we get an abstract simplicial with
set of faces $S$.

\end{subdefi}

\begin{sublemma}[face\_card\_nonzero]
If $K$ is an abstract simplicial complex and $s$ is a face of $K$, then the cardinality of $s$ is a nonzero natural number.

\end{sublemma}

\subsection{Vertices}

\begin{subdefi}[vertices]
Let $K$ be an abstract simplicial complex. Vertices of $K$ are elements $a$ of $\alpha$ such that $\{a\}$ is a face of $K$.

\end{subdefi}

\begin{sublemma}[mem\_vertices]
An element $a$ of $\alpha$ is a vertex of $K$ if and only if $\{a\}$ is a face of $K$.

\end{sublemma}

\begin{sublemma}[vertices\_eq]
The set of vertices of $K$ is the union of the faces of $K$.

\end{sublemma}

\begin{sublemma}[mem\_vertices\_iff]
An element $a$ of $\alpha$ is a vertex of $K$ if and only if there exists a face $s$ of $K$ such that $a\in s$.

\end{sublemma}

\begin{sublemma}[face\_subset\_vertices]
Every face of $K$ is contained in the set of vertices of $K$.

\end{sublemma}


\subsection{Facets}

\begin{subdefi}[facets]
A \emph{facet} of $K$ is a maximal face.

\end{subdefi}

\begin{sublemma}[mem\_facets\_iff]
A finite set of $\alpha$ is a facet of $K$ if and only if it is a face of $K$ and it is maximal among faces of $K$.

\end{sublemma}

\begin{sublemma}[facets\_subset]
Every facet of $K$ is a face of $K$.

\end{sublemma}


\subsection{Partial order on abstract simplicial complexes}

\begin{subdefi}
We define a partial order on the set of abstract simplicial complexes on $\alpha$ by saying that $K$ is less than or equal to $L$
if and only if the set of faces of $K$ is contained in the set of faces of $L$.

\end{subdefi}

\begin{subdefi}[Inf]
If $K$ and $L$ are two abstract simplicial complexes, then $Inf(K,L)$ is the abstract simplicial complexes whose set of faces is
the intersection of the set of faces of $K$ and the set of faces of $L$.

\end{subdefi}

\begin{subdefi}[Sup]
If $K$ and $L$ are two abstract simplicial complexes, then $Sup(K,L)$ is the abstract simplicial complexes whose set of faces is
the union of the set of faces of $K$ and the set of faces of $L$.

\end{subdefi}

\begin{subdefi}[DistribLattice]
A structure of distributive lattice on the set of abstract simplicial complexes on $\alpha$, whose max and min are given by $Sup$ and $Inf$.

\end{subdefi}


\subsection{Finite complexes}

\begin{subdefi}[FiniteComplex]
An abstract simplicial complex is called \emph{finite} if its set of faces is finite.

\end{subdefi}

\begin{sublemma}[Finite\_IsLowerSet]
Every complex smaller than or equal to a finite complex is also finite.

\end{sublemma}

\begin{sublemma}[FiniteComplex\_has\_finite\_facets]
If $K$ is a finite abstract simplicial complex, then its set of facets is finite.

\end{sublemma}


\subsection{Pure complexes and dimension}

\begin{subdefi}[dimension]
Let $K$ be an abstract simplicial complex. The \emph{dimension} of $K$ is the supremum (taken in $\Nat\cup\{\infty\}$) of on the set of faces of $K$ of the function
$s\mapsto card(s)-1$.

\end{subdefi}

\begin{subdefi}[Pure]
Let $K$ be an abstract simplicial complex. We say that $K$ is \emph{pure} if, for every facet $s$ of $K$, the dimension of $K$ is equal to $card(s) -1$.

\end{subdefi}


\subsection{Skeleton and link}

\begin{subdefi}[skeleton]
Let $K$ be an abstract simplicial complex and $d\in\Nat$. The \emph{$d$-skeleton} of $K$ is the abstract simplicial complexes whose faces are
all faces of $K$ of cardinality $\leq d+1$.

\end{subdefi}

\begin{subdefi}[link]
Let $K$ be an abstract simplicial complex and $s$ be a finite subset of $\alpha$. The \emph{link} of $s$ in $K$ is the abstract simplicial complex
whose faces are all the faces $t$ of $K$ that are disjoint from $s$ and such that $s\cup t$ is a face of $K$.

\end{subdefi}


\subsection{Simplicial maps}

\begin{subdefi}[SimplicialMap]
Let $K$ and $L$ be abstract simplicial complexes on the sets $\alpha$ and $\beta$ respectively. A \emph{simplicial map} from $K$ to $L$ is a map
$f$ from $\alpha$ to $\beta$ such that, for every face $s$ of $K$, the finite set $f(s)$ is a face of $L$.

\end{subdefi}

\begin{subdefi}[toFaceMap]
Given a simplicial map $f$ from $K$ to $L$, we get a map $f.toFaceMap$ from the set of faces of $K$ to the set of faces of $L$.

\end{subdefi}

\begin{subdefi}[comp]
Definition of the composition of simplicial maps: it is given by composing the maps on the underlying sets.

\end{subdefi}

\begin{subdefi}[id]
If $K$ is an abstract simplicial complex on $\alpha$, the identity of $K$ is the simplicial map given by the identity of $\alpha$.

\end{subdefi}

\begin{subdefi}[AbstractSimplicialComplexEquiv]
Let $K$ and $L$ be abstract simplicial complexes on the sets $\alpha$ and $\beta$ respectively. A \emph{simplicial equivalence} from $K$ to $L$
is the data of a simplicial map $f:\alpha\to\beta$ from $K$ to $L$ and a simplicial map $g:\beta\to\alpha$ from $L$ to $K$ such that, for
every face $s$ of $K$, we have $g(f(s))=s$ and, for every face $t$ of $L$, we have $f(g(t))=t$.

\end{subdefi}


\subsection{Subcomplex generated}

\begin{subdefi}[SubcomplexGenerated]
Let $K$ be a abstract simplicial complex and $F$ be a set of finite sets of $\alpha$. The \emph{subcomplex of $K$ generated by $F$} is the abstract
simplicial complex whose faces are the faces of $K$ that are contained in an element of $F$.

\end{subdefi}

\begin{sublemma}[SubcomplexGenerated\_mem]
Let $K$ be a abstract simplicial complex and $F$ be a set of finite sets of $\alpha$.
A finite subset $s$ of $\alpha$ is a face of the subcomplex of $K$ generated by $F$ if and only if $s$ is a face of $K$ and there exists $t\in F$ such that
$s \subset t$.

\end{sublemma}

\subsection{Boundary of a simplex}

\begin{subdefi}[Boundary]
Let $K$ be an abstract simplicial complex and $s$ be a face of $K$. The \emph{boundary} of $s$ is the abstract simplicial complex whose faces
are nonempty proper subsets of $s$.\footnote{Hey, we don't need $K$ here !}

\end{subdefi}

\begin{sublemma}[Boundary\_mem]
Let $K$ be an abstract simplicial complex and $s$ be a face of $K$. A finite subset $t$ of $\alpha$ is a face of the boundary of $s$ if and only
if $t$ is a face of $K$, $t$ is included in $s$ and $t \ne s$.

\end{sublemma}

\begin{sublemma}[BoundaryFinite]
Let $K$ be an abstract simplicial complex and $s$ be a face of $K$. Then the boundary of $s$ is a finite complex.
